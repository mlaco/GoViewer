# GoViewer #

A parser and viewer for sgf files, records of games of Go (a.k.a. Igo, Baduk, Weiqi).

## Notes ##

A more efficient implementation of this can be made. I am currently working on that. The existing implementation needs to read the sgf
file for each move. I will make it read once and store in a suitable data structure.
